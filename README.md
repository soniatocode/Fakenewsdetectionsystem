# Fakenewsdetectionsystem
Jupyter notebooks containing the code implementation for Fake News Detection.

Fake news has been around for a lot of time, but with the increase in the use of social media platforms to obtain information the detection of fake news and the credibility of the source has been a popular research topic.  Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information allow users to consume and share the news. On the other hand, it can make viral “fake news” which is low-quality news with intentionally false information. The quick spread of fake news has the potential for calamitous impacts on individuals and society. 

This project is an ongoing one and this repository contains the code implementation of the preprocessing of data and training of models. 

Further implementation will include examination of further metrics such as ROC Curve, confusion matrix, cross validation, precision,recall and twitter user profile analysis wrt fake tweets and their user engagement.
